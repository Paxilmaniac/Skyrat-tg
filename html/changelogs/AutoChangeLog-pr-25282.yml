  - bugfix: "The Peacekeeper Equipment Vendor has been restored to upstream standard contents with adjustments where needed, meaning that energy holsters are available as a premium option."
  - bugfix: "Code-side thing: the reskinned SecTech and reskinned SecDrobe are just renamed, now, and not using entirely redundant resupply packages."
