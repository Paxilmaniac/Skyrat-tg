  - code_imp: "replaced hardcoded values in volume_pump.dm with __DEFINES vars doc: Volume Pump's basic introduction was copied and pasted from the Pressure Pump documentation, and made mention of trying to 'perfect the pressure'. Volume pump doesn't care about pressure until it exceeds it, so there is no 'perfecting' going on."
