  - balance: "The ammo workbench can now be hacked to unlock basic lethals."
  - balance: "The ammo workbench now requires an advanced disk (replaces the old lethal disk) for advanced ammotypes, e.g. incendiary/armor-piercing/hollow-point."
  - balance: "Armor-piercing rounds from the ammobench now require titanium. Incendiary rounds from the ammobench require plasma. Hollow-point rounds still only require iron."
  - balance: "In return for all this, upgraded stock parts now actually matter much more in regards to material consumption efficiency and time efficiency, and the base performance of ammo benches have been mildly improved."
  - rscadd: "There's now 7.62 (.244 Acia) armor-piercing and .45 (.460 Ceres) hollow-point rounds from advanced ammo benches."
  - bugfix: ".244 Acia surplus stripper clips can now be used to hold any .244 Acia from an ammo bench."
  - qol: "Ammo benches now show you what materials are consumed per cartridge as a tooltip."
